a. The Pearson correlation coefficient is a measure of the linear correlation between two variables. latitude and
housing_median_age have a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.0 which makes sense because the location of a block has
nothing to do with the age of the people living there.

b. 1. Latitude and median_income. The final RMSE was 113
   2. I developed the distance from san francisco synthetic feature
def select_and_transform_features(source_df):
  selected_examples = pd.DataFrame()
  selected_examples["median_income"] = source_df["median_income"]
  selected_examples["distance_from_san_francisco"] = source_df["latitude"].apply(
      lambda l: abs(l - 38.0))
  return selected_examples

selected_training_examples = select_and_transform_features(training_examples)
selected_validation_examples = select_and_transform_features(validation_examples)

_ = train_model(
    learning_rate=0.01,
    steps=500,
    batch_size=5,
    training_examples=selected_training_examples,
    training_targets=training_targets,
    validation_examples=selected_validation_examples,
    validation_targets=validation_targets)

The final RMSE was 131
