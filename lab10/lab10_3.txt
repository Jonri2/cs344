a. The confusion matrix shows which numbers were misclassified as other numbers
b. Rather than using Conv2D and Max Pooling to "distill" the input like the Keras example in class, the Tensorflow
version has 2 hidden layers that are 100 nodes wide. I was not able to make improvements to the baseline.
c. The visualizations for 10 steps showed almost no patterns and basically looked just like noise while the
visualizations for 1000 steps were much more concentrated and clear.
