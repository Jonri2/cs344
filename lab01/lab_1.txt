b.i. The GPS problem solver is implemented as a function
b.ii. These objects are Lists
b.iii. Yes it is recursive. It implements recursion through the achieve_all() function which solves subproblems.

c.i. The code models the monkey/banana problem which states that a monkey is in a room with bananas hanging from the
    ceiling. The monkey can reach the banana if it stands on a chair and hits the bananas down with a stick. The code
    is mostly faithful, but has a ball instead of a stick.
c.ii. The domain actions specify the action, the preconditions for the action, the states that are possible after the
    action is completed, and the states that are not possible after the state is completed.
c.iii. The gps solves the problem by working backwards. It starts with the goal state and works backward until it
    reaches the start state. Then it retraces its steps to the goal state using the actions. Here's the stacktrace:
DEBUG:root:  Achieving: not hungry
DEBUG:root:  Consider: eat bananas
DEBUG:root:    Achieving: has bananas
DEBUG:root:    Consider: grasp bananas
DEBUG:root:      Achieving: at bananas

DEBUG:root:        Achieving: at middle room
DEBUG:root:        Achieving: on floor
DEBUG:root:      Action: climb on chair
DEBUG:root:      Achieving: empty handed
DEBUG:root:      Consider: drop ball
DEBUG:root:        Achieving: has ball
DEBUG:root:      Action: drop ball
DEBUG:root:    Action: grasp bananas
DEBUG:root:  Action: eat bananas

c.iv. The gps system at least achieves some level of artificial intelligence since it is able to solve a logical
    problem. It fits the definition of thinking humanly, but since it can't solve all problems it may not even
    successfully meet that definition
c.v. A monkey that solved this problem would be showing intelligence because by solving the problem it would show that
    it can think rationally
