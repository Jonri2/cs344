a. i. There are 1000 training images and 500 test images for both cats and dogs. Each image is 150x150 color pixels
   meaning they have a shape of 150x150x3
   ii. This ConvNet is very similar to the one we did in class. The biggest difference is that the output layer of this
   CNN only needs to output a 0 or 1 (cat or dog) so it uses a sigmoid activation function while the CNN in class needed
   to output 10 probabilities so it used a softmax activation function. The other big difference is that the images in
   this dataset are 3 dimensional since they're color images so they need to be flattened an extra time.
   iii. In the intermediate representations, you can see how the images are much clearer at the top of the network but
   get broken down and less clear as they are "distilled".
