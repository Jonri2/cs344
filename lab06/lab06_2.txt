1. The ML model will predict running times based on previous data.
2. The ideal outcome is to accurately predict race times to give runners and coaches an accurate estimate of what time
   will be run in a race.
3. a. The ML system will succeed if it predicts race times within 1% of the true value >75% of the time.
   b. The key results for the success metrics are the deviation of the predicted time from the actual time.
   c. The ML system will fail it it predicts race times within 1% of the true value <75% of the time.
4. a. The output from the ML model will be the predicted times.
   b. The output is regression.
5. a. The output will be quickly displayed to the user.
   b. The output will be used to give the user information and further improve the system if the user gives a response
      if the prediction was successful.
6. Estimate the time using past times and the variance of previous times.
7. The problem is best formed as unidimensional regression which predicts the next race time based on a previous race
   time, number of miles run, and amount of rest before the race
8. Input 1: Previous race time, Input 2: Number of miles run, Input 3: Amount of rest, Output: Predicted race time
9. Previous race times would be extremely easy to access from online databases, but the miles run and amount of rest
   would have to be logged by the runner, which could be much more difficult to obtain.
10. Previous race time would be very easy to obtain and give a relatively good estimate for initial outcome.
