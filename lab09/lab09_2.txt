a. We regularize with respect to sparsity because a sparse solution will avoid overfitting, thus giving us a better model.
b. Regularization increases sparsity by forcing the model to fit less to the data and thus remember the patterns more
than the data itself. It does this by encouraging weights to be 0.
c. gamma value - 0.75; LogLoss - 0.25, Model Size - 573
