a. Adding more layers or nodes decreased accuracy because it caused more overfitting. Decreasing to 1 hidden layer
slightly increased the accuracy. Using mse instead of binary crossentropy slightly decreased accuracy because the binary
crossentropy loss function is slightly better when dealing with probabilities. tanh performed about the same (but a little worse)
than relu as an activation function because relu is simpler and easier to use.
